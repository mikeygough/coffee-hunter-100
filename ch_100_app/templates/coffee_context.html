    <h2>Coffee Roast Levels:</h2>

  </header>

  <section>
    <dl>
      <dt>Light Roast:</dt>
      <dd>
        Light roasts are roasted for a shorter duration at lower
        temperatures, preserving the natural flavors and acidity of
        the beans. They typically have a light brown color and higher
        acidity, with subtle floral and fruity notes.
      </dd>

      <dt>Medium Roast:</dt>
      <dd>
        Medium roasts are roasted slightly longer than light roasts,
        resulting in a medium brown color. They have a balanced flavor
        profile with moderate acidity and increased sweetness. Medium
        roasts often feature notes of chocolate, caramel, and
        nuttiness.
      </dd>

      <dt>Medium-Dark Roast:</dt>
      <dd>
        Medium-dark roasts have a richer flavor and darker brown color
        compared to medium roasts. They feature a fuller body and more
        pronounced caramelization, with reduced acidity. Medium-dark
        roasts may exhibit notes of bittersweet chocolate and toasted
        nuts.
      </dd>

      <dt>Dark Roast:</dt>
      <dd>
        Dark roasts are roasted for a longer duration at higher
        temperatures, leading to a shiny, oily surface and a deep
        brown or almost black color. Dark roasts have a bold, smoky
        flavor with low acidity and pronounced bitterness. They often
        feature notes of dark chocolate, caramel, and toasted grains.
      </dd>

      <dt>Very Dark Roast (Espresso Roast):</dt>
      <dd>
        Very dark roasts, also known as espresso roasts, are roasted
        to the point of almost burning the beans. They have a glossy,
        nearly black appearance and an intense, robust flavor profile.
        Very dark roasts have minimal acidity and are characterized by
        bold, charred notes with a lingering, bitter finish.

    <h2>Coffee Cultivars:</h2>
    <p>Cultivars are...</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <dl>
      <dt>Arabica:</dt>
      <dd>
        Arabica coffee (Coffea arabica) is the most popular and widely
        cultivated species of coffee. It is known for its smooth, mild
        flavor with varying acidity levels and pleasant aroma. Arabica
        plants are grown at higher altitudes and are more susceptible
        to diseases compared to Robusta coffee.
      </dd>

      <dt>Robusta:</dt>
      <dd>
        Robusta coffee (Coffea canephora) is the second most popular
        species and is known for its strong flavor and higher caffeine
        content compared to Arabica. Robusta coffee plants are more
        robust and resilient, making them suitable for lower altitudes
        and less favorable growing conditions.
      </dd>

      <dt>Typica:</dt>
      <dd>
        Typica is one of the oldest and most traditional Arabica
        coffee cultivars. It originated from Yemen and is known for
        its balanced flavor profile with mild acidity and medium body.
        Typica plants are tall and have lower yields compared to
        modern hybrids.
      </dd>

      <dt>Bourbon:</dt>
      <dd>
        Bourbon is another popular Arabica coffee cultivar known for
        its high-quality beans with a smooth, sweet flavor profile and
        hints of fruitiness. It is named after the island of Bourbon
        (now Réunion) where it was originally cultivated.
      </dd>

      <dt>Caturra:</dt>
      <dd>
        Caturra is a mutation of Bourbon coffee that originated in
        Brazil. It is known for its compact size, which allows for
        denser planting and higher yields. Caturra coffee beans are
        similar in flavor to Bourbon but may have a slightly lighter
        body.
      </dd>

      <dt>Catuai:</dt>
      <dd>
        Catuai is a hybrid of Mundo Novo and Caturra cultivars. It is
        known for its high productivity and adaptability to various
        growing conditions. Catuai coffee beans produce a balanced cup
        with medium acidity and body.
      </dd>

      <dt>Geisha (or Gesha):</dt>
      <dd>
        Geisha coffee originated from Ethiopia but gained popularity
        in Panama, where it produced exceptional cup profiles with
        floral and fruity notes, high acidity, and delicate aroma.
        Geisha coffee is highly sought after and often commands
        premium prices at auctions.

    <h2>Coffee Processes:</h2>
    <p>Processes are...</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <dl>
      <dt>Washed Process (Wet Process):</dt>
      <dd>
        In the washed process, also known as the wet process, freshly
        harvested coffee cherries are pulped to remove the outer skin,
        and the beans are then fermented in water to remove the
        mucilage layer. After fermentation, the beans are washed and
        dried. This method tends to produce coffees with bright
        acidity, clean flavors, and a lighter body.
      </dd>

      <dt>Natural Process (Dry Process):</dt>
      <dd>
        In the natural process, also known as the dry process, ripe
        coffee cherries are dried whole, allowing the beans to ferment
        inside the fruit. Once dried, the outer skin and pulp are
        removed, revealing the dried coffee beans. Natural process
        coffees often have a fuller body, lower acidity, and intense
        fruitiness due to the extended fermentation process.
      </dd>

      <dt>Anaerobic Fermentation:</dt>
      <dd>
        Anaerobic fermentation is a processing method where coffee
        cherries are placed in a sealed container and fermented in the
        absence of oxygen. This controlled fermentation process can
        lead to unique flavor profiles, including fruity, wine-like,
        or fermented notes, depending on the fermentation conditions
        and duration.
      </dd>

      <dt>Honey Process:</dt>
      <dd>
        In the honey process, also known as pulped natural process,
        the outer skin of the coffee cherry is removed, leaving some
        or all of the sticky mucilage intact on the beans. The coffee
        beans are then dried with the mucilage still attached. Honey
        process coffees often have a sweetness and body somewhere
        between washed and natural process coffees.
      </dd>

      <dt>Black Honey Process:</dt>
      <dd>
        In the Black Honey process, the coffee cherries are partially
        depulped, leaving more mucilage intact compared to other honey
        processes. The beans are then dried with the mucilage, which
        results in a longer fermentation period and deeper sweetness.
        Black Honey process coffees typically have a heavier body and
        pronounced sweetness with complex flavor profiles.
      </dd>

      <dt>Red Honey Process:</dt>
      <dd>
        The Red Honey process falls between the Black Honey and Yellow
        Honey processes in terms of mucilage removal. It involves
        removing some of the mucilage from the beans before drying.
        Red Honey process coffees often have a medium to heavy body
        with a balanced acidity and sweet, fruity flavors.
